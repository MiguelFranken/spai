Born and raised in a small town, Claudia grew up with a strong sense of compassion and a desire to help others.\nShe witnessed firsthand the struggles faced by people in her community and felt a calling to make a difference in\ntheir lives. After completing her education, Claudia embarked on a fulfilling career in social work. Her unwavering dedication and empathetic nature quickly earned her a reputation as a compassionate advocate for those in need. She worked tirelessly to support vulnerable individuals and families, providing them with the resources and guidance necessary to overcome their challenges. However, Claudia's path took an unexpected turn when she was diagnosed with a degenerative eye condition in her early thirties. Gradually, her vision began to deteriorate, and she found herself facing the daunting reality of partial sight impairment. The news was disheartening, but Claudia refused to let it define her or hinder her commitment to her work. Determined to continue her career as a social worker, Claudia embraced various assistive technologies to adapt to her changing vision. She relied on a screen magnifier, which enlarged the content on her computer screen, allowing her to read and navigate digital documents more easily.\nAdditionally, she utilized color-changing software that increased contrast, making it easier for her to distinguish\nbetween different elements on her screen. Adapting to her new visual limitations was challenging, but Claudia's\ndetermination and resilience never wavered. She sought support from colleagues, friends, and family, who provided\nemotional encouragement and practical assistance whenever needed. Claudia's commitment to her clients and her passion\nfor her work drove her to continuously learn and adapt, ensuring she could provide the same level of care and support as before her sight impairment. Through her own experiences, Claudia developed a deep understanding of the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities. She became an advocate for accessibility, not only in her workplace but also in the community. Claudia worked with her colleagues to make their office spaces more inclusive and actively sought out training opportunities to expand her knowledge on accessibility and assistive technologies. Outside of her professional life, Claudia became involved in local support groups for people with vision impairments. She shared her own journey and provided guidance to those who were newly adjusting to their sight impairments. Claudia's empathetic nature and ability to connect with others on a personal level made her a trusted source of support and inspiration for many. Now, at the age of 54, Claudia continues to make a significant impact in the lives of her clients. Her unwavering dedication, adaptability, and compassionate nature have made her a highly respected social worker in her community. Despite her sight impairment, Claudia's determination to help others has not faltered, and she remains an inspiration to those around her, proving that with resilience and the right tools, anyone can overcome obstacles and make a meaningful difference in the world.""}","After navigating to Zalando.de’s website, I was excited to purchase something new for my wardrobe. But as soon as I clicked on the product page, I quickly realized that this website was not designed with accessibility in mind. As someone with a vision impairment, I rely on assistive technologies to access websites, and this website had three major issues that made it difficult for me to use. The website had a number of ARIA attributes in roles where they were not allowed and duplicate IDs, which can break the focusable elements and confuse assistive technologies. As a social worker, I see every day how important accessibility is for people with disabilities, and this website is making it difficult for some people to access the same level of service as everyone else. I wish that websites like this were designed with accessibility in mind, giving everyone the opportunity to access the same products and services.",1,923,accessibility,9.49192190170288,negative,0.03405303030303031
